\section{Methods}

The data was analyzed using R version 3.3.2. No extra packages were required.

\subsection{summary statistics}

Data are alwas shown and described as median and median absolute deviation
(MAD) and displayed using boxplots.

\subsection{linear statistical analysis}

As the data was not normal distributed we did use the non parametric spearman
correlation to access the significance level of the answers ranging from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (lots of pain) using the cor.test R function. As the data did
contain many duplicate values (bindings) we added a small error value to the raw data using the R jitter
function and re-ran the statistic test 1000 times each. The
mean p value and mean correlation coefficient are reported.

\subsection{grouped tests}

The Wilcox Signed Rank test was used for two group comparisons performed in the
same way as the linear tests.
